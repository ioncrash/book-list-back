This is a very simple book listing app that runs on Ember and Ruby on Rails. You may need to install Ember if you don't already have it.

## Installation

1. clone this repo, and the front end repo (found here https://github.com/ioncrash/book-list) onto your machine
2. from the terminal, in the repo 'book-list-back', npm install && bundle install
3. make sure you have the front end server running (see instructions on book-list)
4. bundle exec rails server
5. if you want to query the backend server directly, navigate to http://localhost:4741
